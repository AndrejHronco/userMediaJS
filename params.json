Simply call the userMedia object and one of it's 3 current methods: userMedia.getVideo(source), userMedia.getAudio(source), userMedia.getVideoAndAudio(source).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nTo install, there are a few methods:\r\n\r\n**Using Git**\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/skulldev/userMediaJS\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Using your browser**\r\n\r\nVisit the website and download the files simply and easily in .zip or .tar.gz format!\r\n```\r\nhttps://skulldev.github.io/userMediaJS/\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Or visit the github page:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/skulldev/userMediaJS\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n### Capture a users webcam and output to screen\r\n\r\nThis is very simple. All you need to do is call the userMedia.getVideo(source) function.\r\n\r\nThis function has one parameter, the source parameter, which is mandatory. This parameter accepts a css selctor for the output.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<video id=\"output\" autoplay controls></video>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuserMedia.getVideo('#output');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will prompt the user to allow the browser to access their webcam and then if they allow the access, it will output it to the video tag selected.\r\n\r\n### Capture a users microphone sound and playback\r\n\r\nThis is very simple. All you need to do is call the userMedia.getAudi(source) function.\r\n\r\nThis function has one parameter, the source parameter, which is mandatory. This parameter accepts a css selctor for the output.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<audio id=\"output\" controls></audio>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuserMedia.getAudio('#output');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will prompt the user to allow the browser to access their microphone device and then if they allow the access, it will output it to the audio tag selected and playback sound from the microphone.\r\n\r\n### Capture a users webcam and microphone and then output to screen\r\n\r\nThis is very simple. All you need to do is call the userMedia.getVideoAndAudio(source) function.\r\n\r\nThis function has one parameter, the source parameter, which is mandatory. This parameter accepts a css selctor for the output.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<video id=\"output\" autoplay controls></video>\r\n```\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuserMedia.getVideo('#output');\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will prompt the user to allow the browser to access their webcam and microphone and then if they allow the access, it will output it to the video tag selected and playback any sound coming into their microphone also.\r\n\r\n### Why such a framework?\r\n\r\nThe idea of userMediaJS is to be scaleable. I aim to eventually allow not only single user playback but eventually allow multiuser playback and data transmission for anything from recording audio to having two way face to face conversations. In version 1.0.0, I lay a foundation and with the github community and myself, I aim to scale this API in many ways and forms.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n1. Fork it!\r\n2.
